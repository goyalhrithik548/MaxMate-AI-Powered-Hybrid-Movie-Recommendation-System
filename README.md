## 🔍 Project Overview

In the current streaming landscape, users face "decision fatigue." Traditional keyword searches fail to understand nuanced human intent (e.g., *"I want a scary movie that has a happy ending"*).

**MaxMate** bridges this gap by acting as an intelligent "Virtual Concierge." It combines traditional machine learning with modern Generative AI to provide accurate, personalized, and conversational recommendations without sending user data to the cloud.

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. Hybrid Recommendation Engine
* **Engine A (Demographic Filtering):** Solves the "Cold Start" problem for new users by ranking movies using the **IMDB Weighted Rating** formula.
* **Engine B (Content-Based Filtering):** Personalizes results using **Cosine Similarity** on "Bag of Words" vectors (Cast, Director, Keywords, Genres).

### 2. Generative AI Chatbot ('Max')
* **RAG Pipeline:** Uses **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** to fetch relevant movie plots from the dataset and feed them to the LLM.
* **Local Inference:** Powered by a quantized **Microsoft Phi-2** model running entirely on the CPU.
* **No Hallucinations:** The AI is strictly constrained to answer based only on the retrieved context.

### 3. Smart User Interaction
* **Implicit Feedback:** Tracks user engagement (if a user views a movie detail page for >15 seconds).
* **Explicit Feedback:** "Like" and "Save to Watchlist" functionality.
* **Vector Search:** Semantic search capabilities beyond simple keyword matching.

## 🏗 System Architecture

The system follows a modular **Client-Server Architecture**:

1.  **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (AJAX for asynchronous calls).
2.  **Backend:** Flask (Python) handles routing, session management, and API endpoints.
3.  **Database:** MongoDB stores user profiles, hashed passwords, and interaction history.
4.  **AI Engine:**
    * **Memory:** Pre-computed Pickle Artifacts (`.pkl`).
    * **Brain:** `llama-cpp-python` (LLM) and `sentence-transformers` (Embeddings).

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup
Prerequisites
Python 3.10+

MongoDB Community Server (Must be running locally on port 27017)

Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/MaxMate.git](https://github.com/your-username/MaxMate.git)
cd MaxMate
```
Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

📥 Download Assets (Crucial)
To keep the repository light, the AI Models (2GB+) and Data Artifacts are hosted externally. The system will not work without these files.

1. Download the Assets Zip
👉 [PASTE_YOUR_GOOGLE_DRIVE_LINK_HERE] 👈

2. Extract and Place
After downloading the required files, ensure your folder looks exactly like the structure above.

The `models/` folder must contain `phi-2.Q4_K_M.gguf`.

The `Artifacts/` folder must contain the `.pkl files`.

🚀 Usage Guide
   * Start MongoDB: Ensure your local MongoDB instance is running.

   * Run the App:

     ```Bash
     python main.py
     ```

   * Wait for the "Phi-2 Brain Online" message in the terminal.

   * Access the Interface: Open your browser and navigate to: http://127.0.0.1:5000

Explore:

   * Sign Up/Login: Create a local account.

   * Home: Browse trending movies.

   * Chat: Click the chat bubble and ask: "Suggest a sci-fi movie about space travel."

## 🔮 Future Scope
   * Performance: Migrate inference to ONNX Runtime for 2x faster CPU speeds.

    * Voice Integration: Add Whisper AI for voice-to-text search.

   * Cloud Deployment: Dockerize the application for deployment on AWS/Azure.
